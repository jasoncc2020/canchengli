abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play an important role in the epilepsy detection. In the past decades, the automatic detection system of epilepsy has emerged and performed well. In this paper, a novel sparse representation-based epileptic seizure classification based on the dictionary learning with homotopy (DLWH) algorithm is proposed. The performance of the proposed method evaluates on two public EEG databases provided by the Bonn University and Childrens Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT), various classification cases that include health and seizure; non-seizure and seizure; inter ictal (seizure-free interval) and ictal (seizure). The results show that the DLWH only completes the test with 19.671 s compared with the traditional sparse representation methods with high degree of automation, which are better than those obtained using the well-known dictionary learning method. Besides, two publicly available benchmark databases recognition rates are as high as 100%, 99.5%, with average of 99.5% and 95.06%,% respectively, and the results show that the epileptic detection system based on the dictionary learning has a high application value.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we have proposed a classification method for epilepsy EEG signals with a dictionary learning based on the sparse representation, rather than using the original training sample directly as a dictionary. First, we have employed the EEG training sample set as the basis of sparse representation, and the dictionary to obtain the sparse representation coefficient on the EEG by homotopy algorithm. In this system, a test sample training set by minimizing the ℓ1-norm has been proposed. Finally, the EEG sample has been tested with a sparsely coded subject learning dictionary. Then, the reconstruction errors of the seizures and non-epileptic EEG training samples on the test samples are calculated to determine the label of the test samples, which are used for making the decision. Therefore, the classification method have avoids some problems, such as the feature selection, and the information carried by the EEG signal that is completely retained. Hence, its fast speed makes sense for the real-time seizure detection. At the same time, we have created the speed of operation, sensitivity and specificity, as well as recognition accuracy improved to meet requirements of automatic seizures detection. Lastly, the proposed seizure detection system demonstrates the practical applications of real-time function.
